# Normals problem
The "Normals" assignment in CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL asks students to explore normals.db, a database that contains a table named normals. 
This table includes climate data for various global coordinates, detailing normal ocean temperatures at different depths (from the surface to 5500 meters deep).

## Schema
- **normals** table:
  - **id**, which uniquely identifies each row (coordinate) in the table
  - **latitude**, which is the degree of latitude (expressed in decimal format) for the coordinate
  - **longitude**, which is the degree of longitude (expressed in decimal format) for the coordinate
  - **0m**, which is the normal ocean surface temperature (i.e., the normal temperature at 0 meters of depth), in degrees Celsius, at the coordinate
  - **5m**, which is the normal ocean temperature at 5 meters of depth, in degrees Celsius, at the coordinate
  - **10m**, which is the normal ocean temperature at 10 meters of depth, in degrees Celsius, at the coordinate


## Specification and my solutions
- In 1.sql, write a SQL query to find the normal ocean surface temperature in the Gulf of Maine, off the coast of Massachusetts. To find this temperature, look at the data associated with 42.5° of latitude and -69.5° of longitude.
Recall that you can find the normal ocean surface temperature in the 0m column, which stands for 0 meters of depth!
    ```
    SELECT "0m"
    FROM normals
    WHERE latitude = 42.5
    AND longitude = -69.5
    ```

- In 2.sql, write a SQL query to find the normal temperature of the deepest sensor near the Gulf of Maine, at the same coordinate above.
The deepest sensor records temperatures at 225 meters of depth, so you can find this data in the 225m column.
    ```
    SELECT "225m"
    FROM normals
    WHERE latitude = 42.5
    AND longitude = -69.5
    ```

- In 3.sql, choose a location of your own and write a SQL query to find the normal temperature at 0 meters, 100 meters, and 200 meters. You might find Google Earth helpful if you’d like to find some coordinates to use!
    ```
    SELECT "0m", "100m", "200m"
    FROM normals
    WHERE latitude = 89.5
    AND longitude = 171.5
    ```

- In 4.sql, write a SQL query to find the lowest normal ocean surface temperature.
    ```
    SELECT MIN("0m") surface_min_temp
    FROM normals
    ```

- In 5.sql, write a SQL query to find the highest normal ocean surface temperature.
    ```
    SELECT MAX("0m") surface_max_temp
    FROM normals
    ```

- In 6.sql, write a SQL query to return all normal ocean temperatures at 50m of depth, as well as their respective degrees of latitude and longitude, within the Arabian Sea. Include latitude, longitude, and temperature columns. For simplicity, assume the Arabian Sea is encased in the following four coordinates:
    - 20° of latitude, 55° of longitude
    - 20° of latitude, 75° of longitude
    - 0° of latitude, 55° degrees of longitude
    - 0° of latitude, 75° degrees of longitude
    ```
    SELECT latitude, longitude, "50m"
    FROM normals
    WHERE latitude BETWEEN 0 AND 20
        AND longitude BETWEEN 55 AND 75
    ```

- In 7.sql, write a SQL query to find the average ocean surface temperature, rounded to two decimal places, along the equator. Call the resulting column “Average Equator Ocean Surface Temperature”.
The equator’s ocean surface temperatures can be found at all longitudes between the latitudes -0.5° and 0.5°, inclusive.
    ```
    SELECT ROUND(AVG("0m"), 2) 
        "Average Equator Ocean Surface Temperature"
    FROM normals
    WHERE latitude BETWEEN -0.5 AND 0.5
    ```

- In 8.sql, write a SQL query to find the 10 locations with the lowest normal ocean surface temperature, sorted coldest to warmest. If two locations have the same normal ocean surface temperature, sort by latitude, smallest to largest. Include latitude, longitude, and surface temperature columns.
    ```
    SELECT latitude, longitude, "0m"
    FROM normals
    ORDER BY "0m", latitude
    LIMIT 10
    ```

- In 9.sql, write a SQL query to find the 10 locations with the highest normal ocean surface temperature, sorted warmest to coldest. If two locations have the same normal ocean surface temperature, sort by latitude, smallest to largest. Include latitude, longitude, and surface temperature columns.
    ```
    SELECT latitude, longitude, "0m"
    FROM normals
    ORDER BY "0m" DESC, latitude
    LIMIT 10
    ```

- In 10.sql, write a SQL query to determine how many points of latitude we have at least one data point for. (Why might we not have data points for all latitudes?)
    ```
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ROUND(latitude))
    FROM normals    
    ```
